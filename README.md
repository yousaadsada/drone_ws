# Anafi Drone Control System

[output.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6eb0b561-75a4-4ca8-ac12-42ab158c41ff)

This project employs Gazebo to simulate precise payload drops from a quadrotor, modeled with six degrees of freedom. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is used to guide the quadrotor along a desired trajectory. A camera mounted on the quadrotor captures images of a moving vehicle, and a YOLO-based eight-keypoint model is trained to estimate the vehicle's 3D position. A Kalman filter is implemented to refine the vehicle's position and velocity estimates. The quadrotor successfully tracks and delivers the payload to the moving vehicle using visual detection.

### Test Anafi Drone System state

#### Linear MPC

Implementing linear state function for MPC on drone

##### Collect Anafi Drone's Data

```bash
ros2 run anafi_test collect_anafi_data_linear_mpc.py
```
notice:

Enter testing axis after using "key.right" to take off the drone.

Using keyboard for manual control (right, left, w, s, a, d, r, f, c, x) can swith from the tracking mode to manual mode for safety.

##### Calculate and test Anafi Drone's System State Matrix

```bash
python3 src/anafi_test/process_data/calculate_state_function_linear_mpc.py
python3 src/anafi_test/process_data/test_state_function_linear_mpc.py
```

#### Newton-Euler MPC

Implementing reference roll, pitch angles for MPC

##### Collect Anafi Drone's Data

```bash
ros2 run anafi_test collect_anafi_data_newton_euler_mpc.py
```
notice:

Enter testing axis after using "key.right" to take off the drone.

Using keyboard for manual control (right, left, w, s, a, d, r, f, c, x) can swith from the tracking mode to manual mode for safety.

##### Calculate and test Anafi Drone's System State Matrix

```bash
python3 src/anafi_test/process_data/calculate_state_function_newton_euler_mpc.py
python3 src/anafi_test/process_data/test_state_function_newton_euler_mpc.py
```

### Move to Reference Point by Linear MPC

```bash
ros2 run anafi_test move2point_linear_mpc.py
```

notice:

input four float value: x,y,z,yaw for reference point

Using keyboard for manual control (right, left, w, s, a, d, r, f, c, x) can swith from the MPC mode to manual mode for safety.

### Track the Reference Trajectory by Newton-Euler MPC

```bash
ros2 run anafi_test move2point_linear_mpc.py
```

notice:

input eight float value: x,y,z,yaw for initial reference point. x_speed, y_speed, z_speed, yaw_speed for reference point moving speed.

The trajectory is in the shape of the circle. Larger x_speed, y_speed will enhance radius of the circle. The x_speed, y_speed, z_speed and yaw_speed should not exceed 0.3 at the first attempt. User can adjust the trajectory by revising "def update_ref_state_callback" in move2point_linear_mpc.py

Using keyboard for manual control (right, left, w, s, a, d, r, f, c, x) can swith from the MPC mode to manual mode for safety.

### Plot the Drone's Trajectory

```bash
python3 src/anafi_test/process_data/plot_move2point_linear_mpc.py
```
